    <h2>Open Humans Data Export</h2>

    <p>Open Humans is an exciting project that puts participants in charge of
      data sharing.</p>

    <p>Members of Open Humans can aggregate data from various research studies
      and activities, and manage how they share this data with others â€“
      including other researchers, who might want to recruit them to new
      studies! What you share will always be your decision.</p>

    <p>Interested in exporting your data to an Open Humans account? Click the
      button below to begin the process.</p>
